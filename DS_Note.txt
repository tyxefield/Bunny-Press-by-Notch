I found and downloaded BunnyPress from the WayBack Machine as there are not
anymore links to get this game, i did some modifications for the applet so you can play
it in your desktop and revive this little game from Notch..

To play, execute the jar file inside "Uploaded", have fun!

Thank you for making this cool jam game :)

PD 1: This is the original version, without the Reset function, as i
couldn't find this one, i might add the same function as notch did
for reset with space bar or escape. But for now that's all.

PD 2: I included the original files, the main .jar file that doesn't
work and the last one that i edited to play it, along with the devlog.
The index might not work properly cause is an Applet system.
